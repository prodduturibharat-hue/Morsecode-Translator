# Morsecode-Translator

📖 Project Overview
The Morse Code Converter is a simple Python-based GUI application built using the Tkinter library.  
It allows users to input any English word or sentence and instantly converts it into its corresponding Morse code.

This project demonstrates:
- Basic GUI creation using Tkinter  
- Input dialogs and message boxes  
- Use of Python dictionaries for encoding text  
- String manipulation and data mapping concepts

🧩 Features
✅ Convert English text to Morse code  
✅ Simple and interactive GUI (using Tkinter)  
✅ Error handling for empty inputs  
✅ Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

🧠 How It Works
1. The user runs the program.  
2. A dialog box asks the user to input a word or sentence.  
3. The program converts each character into Morse code using a predefined dictionary.  
4. The Morse code output is shown in a message box.
